# auvsi-cv-lineDetection
Learn how to detect lines using MATLAB. The concept of a Hough Transform is demonstrated to show how to use them to extract line segments. Tips on some preprocessing techniques are also provided to improve line detection results. An example of lane detection is used to explain these concepts.
